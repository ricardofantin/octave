# Octave
I put my initial octave functions here. When they are ready, they will be submitted to octave.

Some papers used in the implementation are here too. No copyright infringement intended, they are easy to find on internet. If you have any problem, please ask me and I will remove it.

Working on:

* multithresh/ . Submited, but need a major review. https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?9602 .
* corner/ function. Main function corner.m and have two papers: Harris.pdf and ShiTomasi.pdf
* structural element diamond shape decomposition. Using file get\_diamond\_template.m mainly. Other files are: testSpeed.m, template-diamond.pdf and the imglib2-algorithm package ([https://github.com/tinevez/imglib2-algorithm])
* angl2str
* str2angle

Accepted:

* colorangle.m

Easy functions to me, I'll work on them in the future:

* dist2d
* imfuse
* improfile
* visboundaries

TODO:
immovie and implay should be in movie package???
e-mail about decomposition in big structural element with few 1's elements not processed fast.
