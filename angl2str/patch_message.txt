[octave forge] (mapping) angl2str

Hello,
the code was tested allot. With inline functions I would change some parts, but today it is the best code that I can imagine.

Some additional parameters from round() are needed. The round.m provided should be insert in the same directory before run angl2str. I'll, eventually, update round() function from octave core.

I used a personal repository https://github.com/ricardofantin/octave to manage its versions. Some comments and the test generator to run in MATLAB are available there.

Matlab uses ^{\circ} latex output to represent degrees, Octave uses Â°. Besides it, the outputs are, as far as I know, exactly the same.

Ricardo.
